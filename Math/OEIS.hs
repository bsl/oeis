-- Sequences/) and N-numbers (from the /Handbook of Integer Sequences/) can be
-- used as well.

-- | The same as 'lookupSequenceByID', but in the 'IO' monad.

lookupSequenceByID_IO = getOEIS idSearchURI

-- | Extend a sequence by using it as a lookup to the OEIS, taking the first
-- sequence returned as a result, and using it to augment the original
-- sequence.
--
-- Note that @xs@ is guaranteed to be a prefix of @extendSequence xs@. If the
-- matched OEIS sequence contains any elements prior to those matching @xs@,
-- they will be dropped. In addition, if no matching sequences are found, @xs@
-- will be returned unchanged.
--
-- The result is not in the 'IO' monad even though the implementation requires
-- looking up information via the Internet. There are no side effects, and
-- practically speaking this function is referentially transparent
-- (technically, results may change from time to time when the OEIS database is
-- updated; this is slightly more likely than the results of 'getSequenceByID'
-- changing, but still unlikely enough to be essentially a non-issue. Again,
-- purists may use 'extendSequence_IO').

{- $sample

Suppose we are interested in answering the question, \"how many distinct binary
trees are there with exactly 20 nodes?\" Some naive code to answer this
question might be as follows:

> import Data.List (genericLength)
>
> -- data-less binary trees.
> data BTree = Empty | Fork BTree BTree  deriving Show
>
> -- A list of all the binary trees with exactly n nodes.
> listTrees :: Int -> [BTree]
> listTrees 0 = [Empty]
> listTrees n = [Fork left right |
>                k <- [0..n-1],
>                left <- listTrees k,
>                right <- listTrees (n-1-k) ]
>
> countTrees :: Int -> Integer
> countTrees = genericLength . listTrees

The problem, of course, is that @countTrees@ is horribly inefficient:

@
*Main> :set +s
*Main> countTrees 5
42
(0.00 secs, 0 bytes)
*Main> countTrees 10
16796
(0.47 secs, 27513240 bytes)
*Main> countTrees 12
208012
(7.32 secs, 357487720 bytes)
*Main> countTrees 13
*** Exception: stack overflow
@

There's really no way we can evaluate @countTrees 20@. The solution? Cheat!

> import Math.OEIS
>
> -- countTrees works ok up to 10 nodes.
> -- [1,2,5,14,42,132,429,1430,4862,16796]
> smallTreeCounts = map countTrees [0..10]
>
> -- now, extend the sequence via the OEIS!
> treeCounts = extendSequence smallTreeCounts

Now we can answer the question:

> *Main> treeCounts !! 20
> 6564120420

Sweet.  Of course, to have any sort of confidence in our answer, more research
is required! Let's see what combinatorial goodness we have stumbled across.

@
*Main> description \`fmap\` lookupSequence smallTreeCounts
Just \"Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)\/(n+1) = (2n)!\/(n!(n+1)!). Also called Segner numbers.\"
@

Catalan numbers, interesting.  And a nice formula we could use to code up a
/real/ solution! Hmm, where can we read more about these so-called \'Catalan
numbers\'?

@
*Main> (head . references) \`fmap\` lookupSequence smallTreeCounts
Just [\"A. Bernini, F. Disanto, R. Pinzani and S. Rinaldi, Permutations defining convex permutominoes, preprint, 2007.\"]
*Main> (head . links) \`fmap\` lookupSequence smallTreeCounts
Just [\"N. J. A. Sloane, \<a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.research.att.com\/~njas\/sequences\/b000108.txt\\\"\>The first 200 Catalan numbers\<\/a\>\"]
@

And so on. Reams of collected mathematical knowledge at your fingertips! You
must promise only to use this power for Good.
